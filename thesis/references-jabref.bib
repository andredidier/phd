  Abstract                 = {{T}he term {S}ystems of {S}ystems has increasingly been used to describe classes of systems exhibiting a combination of characteristics such as emergence, autonomy and independent development of their constituent systems. {S}afety is a system property, the achievement of which has a crucial influence on the system’s final acceptance. {D}ue to its importance, safety should be methodically analysed along the system lifecycle. {A} number of standards and recommended practices define the processes and the objectives of the safety lifecycle, such as the {ARP} 4761. {H}owever the artefacts produced during the development of an {S}o{S} differ from ‘traditional’ development. {T}he ({UK}) {M}inistry of {D}efence {A}rchitectural {F}ramework ({MODAF}) – the {UK} equivalent of {DODAF} – is a prominent framework used in the defence domain. {MODAF} is organised in views, each of which focuses on a single aspect of the system operation. {T}he {A}ctivity {B}ased {M}ethodology ({ABM}) has been proposed to structure the products {MODAF}. {T}he paper presents how the traditional safety lifecycle can be adapted in presence of the artefacts used in {S}o{S} development. {M}oreover the paper discusses the {MODAF} products more suitable to reveal {S}o{S} issues affecting safety.},

  Abstract                 = {{F}aults modelling is essential to anticipate failures in critical systems. {T}raditionally, {S}tatic {F}ault {T}rees are employed to this end, but {T}emporal and {D}ynamic {F}ault {T}rees are gaining evidence due to their enriched power to model and detect intricate propagation of faults that lead to a failure.
{I}n previous work, we showed a strategy based on the process algebra {CSP} and {S}imulink models to obtain fault traces that lead to a failure. {A}lthough that work used {S}tatic {F}ault {T}rees, it could be used {T}emporal or {D}ynamic {F}ault {T}rees. {I}n the present work we define an algebra of temporal faults (with a notion of fault propagation) and prove that it is indeed a {B}oolean algebra. {T}his allows us to inherit {B}oolean algebra’s properties, laws and existing reduction techniques, which are very beneficial for faults modelling and analysis. {W}e illustrate our work on a simple but real case study supplied by our industrial partner {EMBRAER}.},

  Abstract                 = {{F}ault {T}ree {A}nalysis is widely used in industry for safety analysis purposes. {C}orrect manual construction of fault trees is difficult, therefore automatic techniques like {DCCA} have been developed. {N}evertheless the resulting minimal critical sets do not contain any information about possible temporal ordering of the failures. {O}n the other hand, in safety critical application, systems are often equipped with backup facilities. {T}his means that a failure in the main system has no longer consequences after the backup system has started to work. {I}n this situation an analysis that does not incorporate temporal ordering of failures would be too pessimistic. {I}n these cases information about temporal ordering of failures like temporal fault tree gates can greatly enhance the accuracy of the results of a safety analysis. {W}e present a method to automatically deduce temporal ordering information for failures directly from system models and critical failure combinations resulting from {FTA} or {DCCA}, based on temporal logic and model checking. },

  Abstract                 = {{T}he main idea of model-based testing ({MBT}) is to automatize the generation and execution of test cases based on a given input model or formal specification of the intended behaviour of the implementation under test ({IUT}). {C}onformance testing is a kind of {MBT} whose objective is to check whether an {IUT} satisfies its specification according to some defined relation (conformance relation). {C}onformance relations are the basis for establishing the properties for the generated tests (e.g. sound test cases), which are used to stimulate the {IUT} (test execution) for the purpose of conformance verification. {I}n the ideal scenario in which the model precisely captures the implementation behaviour, conformance verification would replace the testing activity entirely, being equivalent to exhaustive testing. {H}owever, in the more realistic situation where the model represents only the more critical aspects of an implementation, a combination of conformance verification and testing seems a promising direction to explore. {R}egarding testing, we introduce a strategy for the automatic generation of test cases from parametrised use case templates that capture control flow, state, input and output. {O}ur approach allows test scenario selection based on particular traces or states of the model. {T}he templates are internally represented as {CSP} ({C}ommunicating {S}equential {P}rocesses) processes with explicit input and output alphabets, and test generation is expressed as counter-examples of refinement checking, mechanised using the {FDR} tool. {S}oundness is addressed through an input output conformance relation formally defined in the {CSP} traces model (cspio). {T}his purely process algebraic characterisation of testing has some potential advantages, mainly an easy automation of conformance verification and test case generation via model checking, without the need to develop any explicit algorithm. {C}oncerning automatic conformance verification, we show that it can be captured by a refinement expression that can be mechanically checked using the {CSP} model checker ({FDR}). {M}oreover, although cspio has been defined in terms of the standard {CSP} traces model, we show that our theory can be immediately extended to address quiescence behaviour if a special output event is used. {T}his is formally established by showing that the broader view of cspio is equivalent to {T}retmans' ioco relation. {F}urthermore, we address compositional conformance verification, establishing compositionality properties for cspio with respect to process composition operators. {P}articularly, we show that, assuming input inclusion of the implementation, all the {CSP} operators respect the conformance relation. {W}eaker conditions are explored for the choice operator. {A}n immediate consequence of the equivalence between relations is that the same refinement expression used for verification of cspio can be used to verify ioco, and the compositionality results that apply for cspio are also valid for ioco, provided quiescence is considered. {T}he proposed strategy and theory has been applied in practice to testing mobile device functionalities, in the context of an industrial cooperation with {M}otorola {I}nc.},

  Abstract                 = {{F}ormal safety analysis methods have gained a lot of importance during the last years. {A}ll these methods have in common, that they rely on a formal model of a system which describes desired, functional behavior as well as unwanted erroneous behavior correctly. {M}ost of the time the formal models are created in an ad hoc manner. {T}his is very error prone and therefore compromises the benefit of the following formal analysis. {I}n this paper we present a systematic approach to formally model failure modes. {T}he approach can be combined with most formal safety analysis. {W}e apply the method to a real world case study: a radio-based railroad crossing. {W}e illustrate the results by applying a formal safety analysis method on the model.},

  Abstract                 = {{Recent work in the area of safety analysis has shown that system Fault Trees and Failure Modes and Effects Analyses (FMEAs) can be automatically derived from a topological model of the system that has been annotated with local, component-level, specifications of failure. In this paper, the concept of a component failure specification is extended to enable description and reuse of generalized patterns of failure behaviour that are commonly exhibited by components. A language for the description of such patterns is specified, useful patterns are presented and the use of such patterns is demonstrated on an example of a Time-Triggered system. The paper tentatively concludes that careful reuse of failure patterns in conjunction with automated fault tree and FMEA synthesis algorithms can help to rationalize, and simplify, complex safety assessments.}},

  Abstract                 = {{Java provides support for concurrent and parallel programming throughthreads, monitors and its socket and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) classes.However, there have been many concerns expressed about the way in which thissupport is provided, e.g., [1][2], citing problems such as improper implementation ofmonitors and difficulty of programming with threads. Hoare\^A's CommunicatingSequential Processes (CSP) [3][4][5] model fully specifies thread synchronizationand is based on processes, compositions, and channel communication. It provides amathematical notation for describing patterns of communication using algebraicexpressions and contains formal proofs for analyzing, verifying and eliminatingundesirable conditions, such as race hazards, deadlocks, livelock, and starvation.Two independent research efforts provide a CSP based process-oriented designpattern for concurrency implemented in Java: Communicating Sequential Processesfor Java (JCSP) [6] and Communication Threads in Java (CTJ) [7]. In this paper, wecompare these two packages, looking at the philosophy behind their development,their similarities, their differences, their performance, and their use.}},

  Abstract                 = {{E}merging safety analysis techniques use composition of failure models or fault simulation in formal models of a system to determine relationships between the causes and effects of failure. {M}ost recent work has focused on developing system modelling and algorithms for automatic safety analysis. {H}owever, little work has focused on developing principles to improve reuse of safety analyses in the context of these techniques. {I}n this paper, we describe a generalised failure logic ({GFL}) that can capture abstract reusable characteristics of failure behaviour and show how the {GFL} can be used with templates for the specification of reusable and inheritable component failure patterns. {F}inally, we illustrate how such patterns can be used with {H}i{P}-{HOPS}, an automated fault tree and {FMEA} synthesis tool, in order to simplify safety analysis while formalising and improving reuse. {B}enefits of this approach are discussed in the light of a case study on a brake-by-wire example.},

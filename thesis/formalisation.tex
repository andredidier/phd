\chapter{Formalisation of Hazard Management}

Hazard properties, extracted from~\cite{ericsonII2005}:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Hazardous element (HE);
  \item Initiating mechanisms (IM): sequence of events to activate the hazard;
  \item Target and Threat (T/T): the person or system and its corresponding threat;
  \item Status: open or closed. A hazard can only be closed if it has been verified through analysis, inspection or testing that the safety requirements are implemented in the design and successfully tested for effectiveness.
  \item Mitigation: lists the recommended actions obtained by all analysis
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Eliminate through design selection;
    \item Incorporate safety devices;
    \item Provide warning devices;
    \item Develop procedures and training;
    \item Control hazard through design methods.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Mishap Risk Index (initial, current, final) -- qualitative measurement:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Severity
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Catastrophic;
      \item Critical;
      \item Marginal;
      \item Negligible.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Probability
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Frequent;
      \item Probable;
      \item Occasional;
      \item Remote;
      \item Improbable.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize} 
\end{enumerate}

Scope of system to which Hazard Analysis make sense: those that have signal, material and energy.
%
All system functional elements~\cite[p. 47]{KSS+2011} are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Signal---generate, transmit, distribute, and receive signals used in passive or active sensing and in communications;
  \item Data---analyse, interpret, organize, query, and/or convert data and information into forms desired by the user or other systems;
  \item Material---provide system structural support or enclosure, or transform the shape, composition, or location of material substances;
  \item Energy---provide and convert energy or propulsive power to the system.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[Identifier]
It can be modelled as any user-defined data type. It can be a sequence of alphanumeric symbols (a descriptive text of the element) or a natural number (for example: an identification of a system element). It is a basic data type $Id$ used in other definitions.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Component]
A component is any functional or physical block within a system that may contain 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Hazardous element]
A hazardous element represents an element that can potentially harm someone or something.
$\hmdatatypeHE: Id$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Initiating mechanism]
An initiating mechanism is an event on the system.
%
$\hmdatatypeIM: Id$
%it can be a CSP process. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Target/Threat]
A target and threat pair represents the person or system that is harmed if a hazardous element is activated by the initiating mechanisms and the nature of the harm. 
%
$\hmdatatypeTT: \hmcartesian{Id}{Id}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Hazard]
Given a hazardous element $HE$, a sequence of $n$ initiating mechanisms $\hmseqenum{IM_1, \ldots, IM_n}$ and a target-threat pair $T/T$, a hazard $H$ is defined as: 
%
$H: \hmcartesian{\hmcartesian{\hmdatatypeHE}{\hmdatatypeTT}}{\hmseq \hmdatatypeIM}$,
%
which can be written as:
%
\\$H \hmdefs \hmhazard{HE}{\hmseqenum{IM_1, \ldots, IM_n}}{T/T}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Hazard activation probability]
Given a probability function $\hmprobabilitysymbol$, such that $P: \hmpartialfunction {Id}{\hmdatatypereal}$, a hazardous element $HE$, a sequence of $n$ initiating mechanisms $\hmseqenum{HM_1,\ldots,HM_n}$ and a target-threat pair $T/T$, the probability of the activation of the hazard $H = \hmhazard{HE}{\hmseqenum{HM_1,\ldots,HM_n}}{T/T}$ is:
%
\\$\hmprobability{H} = \hmtimes{\hmprobability{HE}}{\hmtimes{\hmtimes{\hmprobability{IM_1}}{\ldots}}{\hmprobability{IM_n}}}$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Mishap]
A mishap is defined as a pair of the probability of a hazard and the severity in case it happens: $M: \hmcartesian{\hmdatatypereal}{\hmdatatypeseverity}$.
\end{definition}
%
\noindent Where $\hmdatatypeseverity \subset \hmdatatypenatural$ has the following values:
\begin{description}
  \item[1] Catastrophic;
  \item[2] Critical;
  \item[3] Marginal and
  \item[4] Negligible.
\end{description}
